    "2.the improved version is preferable for both readability and explainability. It is more concise, avoids unnecessary complexity, and better conveys the core concepts of the Monty Hall problem in a way that’s easier to teach, understand, and maintain. The original code, while functional, is more verbose and contains steps that could confuse readers, making it harder to explain and less efficient."

    "(1)Chatbbot was able to quickly explain the purpose and functionality of the YouTube embedding code because it involves a well-known Jupyter Notebook feature (IPython.display). This is a straightforward task with minimal complexity, so providing a quick and clear answer was simple. It was trained on various programming concepts, algorithms, and applications, so recognizing patterns like text generation with Markov Chains is second nature. This allows it to quickly identify the purpose and explain it clearly.\n",

The chatbot is so familar with each of the contents, so it is a really healpful way to use chatbot during the leanring of statistics. I also think people need to master the skill of using chatbot during learning. Because in the future, the knowledge of chatbot will exceed the knowledge of a single person, so people should know how to use chatbot to combine with their own skills."

We discussed how these skills are essential in the data science industry and how they contribute to career success.\n",

    "Additionally, we examined whether it would be possible to work as a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis. The conclusion was that these skills are fundamental to these roles, and without them, one would be working in adjacent roles rather than as a true practitioner in these fields.\n",
    "\n",
